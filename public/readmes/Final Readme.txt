Hi.

I created a functional front-end for the Advizzy site. All the elements are there, but you'll have to write some JavaScript to make certain elements interact. I didn't write any JavaScript except for a couple short inline statements.

I used Zurb's Foundation for the layout framework and FontAwaesome for the icons.

I used Zurb's dropdown boxes in some of the menus, Zurb's "modals" for the popups, and Zurb's tabs for the tabbed elements.

The tabbed elements might get confusing because there are tabs-within-tabs (as the PSD specified) and I had to fill them with "dummy-content" to build and demonstrate how they'll work. You'll be dynamically generating that stuff and it will be easier to manage. I wrote lots of notes and documentation but if there's anything you need explained you can send me an email, text, or phone call.


The CSS file has many of my own site-specific classes. Generic stuff is at the top, and page/element-specific stuff is lower down on the page.
