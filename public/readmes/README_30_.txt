Hello.

I wrote 30.html today.

I added more CSS classes to the CSS file but I don't think I changed any of the existing ones.
The new CSS classes should be clearly marked in specially labelled sections.

For checkboxes, sliders, and radio buttons I used the nice-looking Foundation options. They should work fine, except you will need to fine tune the slider with JavaScript to make it update the number input for "max_requests." It worked for me in Chrome, but not in Firefox.
