Notes:

CHANGES TO EXISTING FILES:

-in style.css I changed the font size of the SELECT input elements so you can see the whole word.

-in style.css I added a transition time to the border-color-change for :hover over the custom_white-button elements





For page 05.html:

-The avatar popup is a "modal" div at the bottom of the page.



For page 06.html:

-It requires JavaScript to replace the file-upload input with a button, so I just put the button and I'll leave it up to you to make the javascript.



For page 07.html:

-Just like in page 06, replacing those radio options with buttons will require some JavaScript, so I'm just putting the buttons there and you can link them to the input elements.

-Also (just in case site visitors might actually care), "Male" and "Female" are sexes, not genders. Genders are "Man" and "Woman." Makes no difference to me, but some stickler might care. I just did it like the PSD dictated.


For pages 16-17-18-19.html:

These are all just page 16. The popups are "modals" which can be triggered by clicking the right buttons.

The advice/inquiries/questions are part of a tab system all built into page 16. It may be confusing. I documented everything but there's still a lot of code. When you actually implement it then it will probably be simpler because you'll programatically generate the content, instead of the massive wall of placeholder content that I had to put in to demonstrate the functionality.
